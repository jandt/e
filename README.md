# e

This is going to be a clone of [LaPingvino's](https://github.com/LaPingvino) phantastic editor [e](https://github.com/LaPingvino/e), rewritten in [Red](https://www.red-lang.org).

This work is in its earliest stages, but this README is already written in it.

There is one important difference to the original implementation: Line moving with `:` is relative. Other details are missing or different. And there will probably never be runjs command but a runred command.

Have Fun. And thanks to LaPingvino for the inspiration.

## Esperanto

There should be some mentioning of Esperanto in this text. So here it is: Esperanto is very good.
